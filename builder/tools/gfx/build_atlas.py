"""Scene sprite atlas for the Mania PS1 port (docs/ports/mania/32 3.1b; golden rule: build time only).

Input: the scene's manifest (tools/gfx/manifests/<Folder><N>.txt: the sprite files `SPR` and sheets `SHT` the scene
loads, captured from the running game with tools/gfx/capture_manifest.gdb), the sprite files as the disc has them
(build/iso/Data/Sprites: SmallFont and SuperButtons trimmed by tools/data_disc.py) and the source sheets (GIFs).

- Every frame of every animation of the loaded files is placed, as its full rect (Mania's frames are tight: 96% of
  GHZ1's rect area is inside the opaque bounds); identical rects once; a frame inside another frame's rect is drawn
  from it; frames that only overlap are stored apart.
- Player files (Players/*.bin; user decision 2026-09-26, docs/ports/mania/32 3.1 fit): each character's frames reduced to <= 15
  colours per frame with one merge map for all of that character's sheets (a colour folded into its nearest colour in
  RGB, least pixels x distance first, until every frame has <= 15): shades can't flicker between frames and palette
  effects (Super) stay coherent. Every other sprite is exact.
- Big sprites at half resolution (user decision 2026-09-26: bosses, big effects, UI art), only where the scene needs
  it: the fewest HALF_PLAN steps that fit (9c: level art at 15 colours first, then Super Sonic, big effects, pictures,
  presentation art, set pieces, the HUD's art, bosses last, each from a side of 96 / 64 / 48 / 32 px down; the title
  card's letters and the HUD's text never); such a frame is stored halved (each 2x2 block -> its most common opaque index) and
  drawn 2x (binding bit 6). Badniks, springs, rings, platforms… are never halved.
- Character art (players, the title screen's Sonic: PLAYER_LIKE) is 15 colours per frame at full size.
- A cluster with <= 15 colours is 4-bit (clusters share 16-entry CLUTs of palette indices, entry 0 transparent),
  otherwise 8-bit on the palette bank's CLUT.
- Clusters are packed (skyline, tallest first) into the texture columns the scene's tiles leave (tools/gfx/vram_plan.py;
  an 8-bit page takes two adjacent columns, or one with u < 128).
Self-check: every frame region is decoded back from the VRAM image + CLUT maps and compared with its source pixels
(after the players' colour merge); the merge's changes are reported.
